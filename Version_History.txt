====================================================================================================

February 16, 2015:
	- Jacob added:
		+ Preliminary level 3 platform model
		+ Updated level 2 to include central obstacle
		+ Added updated marble model
	- Charlie, Chris, and Kyle continued work on level 1:
		+ Added kill zone boundary.
		+ Added spawn point.
		+ Spawn point keeps marble in place during level starting phase.
	- Kyle tweaked some things to make level creation and debugging easier:
		+ Created prefabs for kill zone, spawning pad, and finish line to easily drag them into new levels.
		+ Kill zone boundary is now visible in scene view (purposefully disappears when playing).
		+ Spawning pad now referred to by the GameMaster and locks the marble more neatly.
		+ GameMaster's game states now cooperate more and are easy to change via debug GUI.
		+ InputManager made neater, and now allows for adding debug controls for, well, debugging.
		+ Added decent default values to camera's orientation and positioning.
