/// Generic class for areas that have modified gravity.
///  
/// NOTES: - May become laggy if multiple objects are stuck colliding in the center constantly.
/// 	   - As it is currently, this script is usable in any project, not just Marballs.
/// 
/// TO DO: - Tweak behavior until desired.
/// 	   - Finetune behavior when object has reached the center of the gravity source.
/// 	   - Add editor script so it performs more nicely in the inspector.
