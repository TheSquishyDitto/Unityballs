/// Class for deadly sphere that sucks in other objects.
///  
/// NOTES: - May become laggy if multiple objects are stuck colliding in the center constantly.
/// 	   - As it is currently, this script is usable in any project, not just Marballs.
/// 
/// TO DO: - Tweak behavior until desired.
/// 	   - Make non-marble objects get destroyed when they touch it.
