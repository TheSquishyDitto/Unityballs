/// General class for granting/clearing buffs via trigger.
/// 
/// NOTES: - Any buff source classes that inherit from this should have their own buffing functions.
/// 	   - Currently always overwrites the marble's currently held buff.
///        - If there was a nice one or two line way to convert the enum into a method/function name, having separate classes would be mostly unnecessary.
/// 
/// TO DO: - Investigate ways to make the inheritance unnecessary.
/// 	   - Decide on respawn mechanics: timer vs player must use first.
