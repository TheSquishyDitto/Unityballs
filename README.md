# Unityballs
	The actual game of Marballs we will be creating through the Unity game engine.
	This readme will be updated as relevant information comes up.

##GIT PRACTICES:
	- *Pull before modifying anything!* If someone else modifies something before you're done, pull it in anyway!
	- After you're done making changes, push to your branch and send a pull request to Chris's branch.
	- Try to avoid modifying the same files/lines that others are working on at the same time.
	- If there's a merge conflict and you're using "*Git GUI*", do the following:
		* Click on a conflicting file.
		* Right click on the area that shows the file's content.
		* Choose which version of the file to keep: local is your version, remote belongs to the other branch.
	
##CODING PRACTICES:
	###Naming Conventions:
		- Anything named should have a name reflecting its purpose. (ex. a calculating function can be named Calculate, but probably not Donut)
		- Constant names should be in ALL CAPS. (ex: const float PI = 3.14)
		- Variable names should use camelBack casing. (ex: int num, float preciseNum)
		- Function, file, object, class, and enum declaration names should use CamelCaps. (ex. void FixedUpdate())
		
	###Comments:
		- Comments should typically use // and be placed after or above the line they are explaining.
		- All functions and important variables should have an accompanying comment explaining their purpose.
			* Function comments should be of the format: // FunctionName - Explanation
		- All scripts should have a comment section at the beginning of the file with the following information:
			...
			/// <summary> [this and the closing tag are generated by Unity after typing ///]
			/// Filename.type
			/// Authors: [if you contribute or modify the code, add your name]
			/// Date Created:	MMM. DD, YYYY
			/// Last Revision: 	MMM. DD, YYYY [update this if you change the code]
			///
			/// Explanation of script's general purpose.
			///
			/// NOTES: [list of things to be aware of when using script]
			///
			/// TO-DO: [list of things that need doing]
			///
			/// </summary>
			...
		
	###General:
		- FixedUpdate is always called at a consistent rate. To easily make things framerate independent, use FixedUpdate instead of Update.
		- Aim for modularity and reusability!
		- Avoid redundant code where possible.
	
	###Coroutine Usage:
		- WaitForSeconds values that are too small (~3 decimal places) will default to the length of a frame! Consider using a different WaitFor___ function.
		- Coroutines may seem like they run in parallel, but they occupy the same thread space.
